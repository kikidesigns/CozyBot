## Components:

1. Smartphone
   - Runs the CozyBot mobile app
   - Connects to Bluetooth devices
   - Communicates with the cloud server

2. Bluetooth Speaker/Microphone
   - Any compatible Bluetooth audio device
   - Receives audio output from the app
   - Captures user's voice input

3. Cloud Server
   - Hosts the AI model for natural language processing
   - Stores user profiles and preferences
   - Processes requests and generates responses

4. Internet Connection
   - Allows communication between the smartphone and cloud server

## Data Flow:

1. User speaks to the Bluetooth microphone
2. Audio is captured and sent to the smartphone via Bluetooth
3. CozyBot app processes the audio and sends the request to the cloud server
4. AI model on the cloud server generates a response
5. Response is sent back to the smartphone
6. CozyBot app converts the response to speech
7. Audio is played through the Bluetooth speaker

This schematic provides a high-level overview of how the CozyBot prototype components interact. The actual implementation may require additional components and more complex interactions depending on the specific features and requirements of the project.
